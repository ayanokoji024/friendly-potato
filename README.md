## Assignment 1 ML Lab by Anomitro Das

Construct a machine learning based model for classification using Python for the 
following UCI datasets (can be loaded from the package itself):

  a. Iris plants dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris/

  b. Diabetes dataset: https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html

  c. Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

### Things to do:
  - Employ Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial & Bernoulli) classifier and show classification results (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-score, confusion matrix).

  - Use Decision Tree classifier for all the three datasets and show classification 
  results (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-score, confusion matrix). Generate the 
  decision tree images for all cases highlighting information like Gini and 
  Entropy.
  Tune the parameters such that the maximum possible performance is achieved 
  (90%<=performance<=100%)
